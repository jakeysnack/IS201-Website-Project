    <p>This is just a little page all about me! The first thing that you need to know about me is 
       that I love to be active. The only problem there is that I hurt my ankle in High School so the 
       things that I can actually do are very limited, however I still can have fun playing Pickleball 
       or Skiing. I teach at the MTC, and I think that might be the best job that was ever created. 
       I love to spend time with my family, and I also love to go on long drives up the canyon by myself 
       just to think about life. Whether there's music or a U2 album, both are good.</p>
